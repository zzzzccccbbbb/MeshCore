## BLE Connection

### Service and Characteristics

MeshCore Companion devices expose a BLE service with the following UUIDs:

- **Service UUID**: `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- **RX Characteristic** (App → Firmware): `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- **TX Characteristic** (Firmware → App): `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`

### Connection Steps

1. **Scan for Devices**
    - Scan for BLE devices advertising the MeshCore Service UUID
    - Optionally filter by device name (typically contains "MeshCore" prefix)
    - Note the device MAC address for reconnection

2. **Connect to GATT**
    - Connect to the device using the discovered MAC address
    - Wait for connection to be established

3. **Discover Services and Characteristics**
    - Discover the service with UUID `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
    - Discover the RX characteristic `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
        - Your app writes to this, the firmware reads from this
    - Discover the TX characteristic `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
        - The firmware writes to this, your app reads from this

4. **Enable Notifications**
    - Subscribe to notifications on the TX characteristic to receive data from the firmware

5. **Send Initial Commands**
    - Send `CMD_APP_START` to identify your app to firmware and get radio settings
    - Send `CMD_DEVICE_QUERY` to fetch device info and negotiate supported protocol versions
    - Send `CMD_SET_DEVICE_TIME` to set the firmware clock
    - Send `CMD_GET_CONTACTS` to fetch all contacts
    - Send `CMD_GET_CHANNEL` multiple times to fetch all channel slots
    - Send `CMD_SYNC_NEXT_MESSAGE` to fetch the next message stored in firmware
    - Setup listeners for push codes, such as `PUSH_CODE_MSG_WAITING` or `PUSH_CODE_ADVERT`
    - See [Commands](#commands) section for information on other commands

**Note**: MeshCore devices may disconnect after periods of inactivity. Implement auto-reconnect logic with exponential backoff.

### BLE Write Type

When writing commands to the RX characteristic, specify the write type:

- **Write with Response** (default): Waits for acknowledgment from device
- **Write without Response**: Faster but no acknowledgment

**Platform-specific**:

- **Android**: Use `BluetoothGattCharacteristic.WRITE_TYPE_DEFAULT` or `WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE`
- **iOS**: Use `CBCharacteristicWriteType.withResponse` or `.withoutResponse`
- **Python (bleak)**: Use `write_gatt_char()` with `response=True` or `False`

**Recommendation**: Use write with response for reliability.

### MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

The default BLE MTU is 23 bytes (20 bytes payload). For larger commands like `SET_CHANNEL` (50 bytes), you may need to:

1. **Request Larger MTU**: Request MTU of 512 bytes if supported
    - Android: `gatt.requestMtu(512)`
    - iOS: `peripheral.maximumWriteValueLength(for:)`
    - Python (bleak): MTU is negotiated automatically

### Command Sequencing

**Critical**: Commands must be sent in the correct sequence:

1. **After Connection**:
    - Wait for BLE connection to be established
    - Wait for services/characteristics to be discovered
    - Wait for notifications to be enabled
    - Now you can safely send commands to the firmware

2. **Command-Response Matching**:
    - Send one command at a time
    - Wait for a response before sending another command
    - Use a timeout (typically 5 seconds)
    - Match response to command by type (e.g: `CMD_GET_CHANNEL` → `RESP_CODE_CHANNEL_INFO`)

### Command Queue Management

For reliable operation, implement a command queue.

**Queue Structure**:

- Maintain a queue of pending commands
- Track which command is currently waiting for a response
- Only send next command after receiving response or timeout

**Error Handling**:

- On timeout, clear current command, process next in queue
- On error, log error, clear current command, process next

---

## Packet Structure

The MeshCore protocol uses a binary format with the following structure:

- **Commands**: Sent from app to firmware via RX characteristic
- **Responses**: Received from firmware via TX characteristic notifications
- **All multi-byte integers**: Little-endian byte order (except CayenneLPP which is Big-endian)
- **All strings**: UTF-8 encoding

Most packets follow this format:
```
[Packet Type (1 byte)] [Data (variable length)]
```

The first byte indicates the packet type (see [Response Parsing](#response-parsing)).

---

## Commands

### 1. App Start

**Purpose**: Initialize communication with the device. Must be sent first after connection.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0: 0x01
Bytes 1-7: Reserved (currently ignored by firmware)
Bytes 8+: Application name (UTF-8, optional)
```

**Example** (hex):
```
01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 6d 63 63 6c 69
```

**Response**: `PACKET_SELF_INFO` (0x05)

---

### 2. Device Query

**Purpose**: Query device information.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0: 0x16
Byte 1: 0x03
```

**Example** (hex):
```
16 03
```

**Response**: `PACKET_DEVICE_INFO` (0x0D) with device information

---

### 3. Get Channel Info

**Purpose**: Retrieve information about a specific channel.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0: 0x1F
Byte 1: Channel Index (0-7)
```

**Example** (get channel 1):
```
1F 01
```

**Response**: `PACKET_CHANNEL_INFO` (0x12) with channel details

---

### 4. Set Channel

**Purpose**: Create or update a channel on the device.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0: 0x20
Byte 1: Channel Index (0-7)
Bytes 2-33: Channel Name (32 bytes, UTF-8, null-padded)
Bytes 34-49: Secret (16 bytes)
```

**Total Length**: 50 bytes

**Channel Index**:
- Index 0: Reserved for public channels (no secret)
- Indices 1-7: Available for private channels

**Channel Name**:
- UTF-8 encoded
- Maximum 32 bytes
- Padded with null bytes (0x00) if shorter

**Secret Field** (16 bytes):
- For **private channels**: 16-byte secret
- For **public channels**: All zeros (0x00)

**Example** (create channel "YourChannelName" at index 1 with secret):
```
20 01 53 4D 53 00 00 ... (name padded to 32 bytes)
    [16 bytes of secret]
```

**Note**: The 32-byte secret variant is unsupported and returns `PACKET_ERROR`.

**Response**: `PACKET_OK` (0x00) on success, `PACKET_ERROR` (0x01) on failure

---

### 5. Send Channel Message

**Purpose**: Send a text message to a channel.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0: 0x03
Byte 1: 0x00
Byte 2: Channel Index (0-7)
Bytes 3-6: Timestamp (32-bit little-endian Unix timestamp, seconds)
Bytes 7+: Message Text (UTF-8, variable length)
```

**Timestamp**: Unix timestamp in seconds (32-bit unsigned integer, little-endian)

**Example** (send "Hello" to channel 1 at timestamp 1234567890):
```
03 00 01 D2 02 96 49 48 65 6C 6C 6F
```

**Response**: `PACKET_MSG_SENT` (0x06) on success

---

### 6. Send Channel Data Datagram

**Purpose**: Send a binary datagram to a channel. Unlike channel text messages, datagrams carry no built-in sender identity and no timestamp — applications needing either must encode them inside the binary payload.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0:                         0x3E
Byte 1:                         Channel Index (0-7)
Byte 2:                         Path Length (0xFF = flood, otherwise actual path length)
Bytes 3 .. 2+path_len:          Path (omitted when path_len == 0xFF)
Next 2 bytes (little-endian):   Data Type (`data_type`, uint16)
Remaining bytes:                Binary payload (variable length)
```

**Example** (flood, `DATA_TYPE_DEV`, payload `A1 B2 C3`, channel 1):
```
3E 01 FF FF FF A1 B2 C3
```

**Data Type / Transport Mapping**:
- `0x0000` (`DATA_TYPE_RESERVED`) is invalid and rejected with `PACKET_ERROR`.
- `0xFFFF` (`DATA_TYPE_DEV`) is the developer namespace for experimenting and developing apps.
- Values `0x0001`–`0xFFFE` are available for registered application/community namespaces. See the [Registered data_type values](#registered-data_type-values) table below.

**Limits**:
- Maximum payload length is `MAX_CHANNEL_DATA_LENGTH = MAX_FRAME_SIZE - 9 = 163` bytes.
- Larger payloads are rejected with `PACKET_ERROR` (`ERR_CODE_ILLEGAL_ARG`).

**Response**: `PACKET_OK` (0x00) on success, or `PACKET_ERROR` (0x01) with one of:
- `ERR_CODE_NOT_FOUND` (2) — unknown `channel_idx`
- `ERR_CODE_ILLEGAL_ARG` (6) — invalid `path_len`, reserved `data_type` (`0x0000`), or payload larger than `MAX_CHANNEL_DATA_LENGTH`
- `ERR_CODE_TABLE_FULL` (3) — outbound send queue is full; retry later

**Inbound datagrams** are delivered to the host via `RESP_CODE_CHANNEL_DATA_RECV` (0x1B); see [Receive Channel Data Datagram](#receive-channel-data-datagram).

#### Registered `data_type` values

`data_type` is an **application identifier**, not a payload-format identifier. Each registered value identifies an application that owns its own internal payload schemas. The firmware does not inspect payload contents — `data_type` is transported opaquely.

| Value           | Constant             | Purpose                                                                                |
|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0000          | `DATA_TYPE_RESERVED` | Reserved; invalid on send                                                              |
| 0x0001 – 0x00FF | —                    | Reserved for internal use                                                              |
| 0x0100 – 0xFEFF | —                    | Registered application namespaces (see [number_allocations.md](number_allocations.md)) |
| 0xFF00 – 0xFFFE | —                    | Testing/development; no registration required                                          |
| 0xFFFF          | `DATA_TYPE_DEV`      | Developer/experimental namespace                                                       |

To register a new application, submit a PR adding a row to the table in [docs/number_allocations.md](number_allocations.md). Internal sub-formats within an allocated application ID are owned by that application and are not tracked in MeshCore firmware or this document.

### Receive Channel Data Datagram

Inbound group datagrams (radio-level `PAYLOAD_TYPE_GRP_DATA`, 0x06) are forwarded to the host as `RESP_CODE_CHANNEL_DATA_RECV` notifications.

**Frame Format** (`RESP_CODE_CHANNEL_DATA_RECV`, 0x1B):
```
Byte 0:                 0x1B (packet type)
Byte 1:                 SNR (signed int8, scaled ×4 — divide by 4.0 to recover dB)
Bytes 2-3:              Reserved (clients MUST ignore)
Byte 4:                 Channel Index (0-7)
Byte 5:                 Path Length (actual path length when flooded, otherwise 0xFF for direct)
Bytes 6-7:              Data Type (uint16 little-endian)
Byte 8:                 Data Length
Bytes 9 .. 8+data_len:  Payload
```

**Path bytes are not forwarded**: Only `path_len` is reported in the receive frame — the path itself is not copied to the host. There are no path bytes between byte 5 and the data_type field at bytes 6–7, regardless of `path_len`.

**Path Length semantics differ between send and receive**:

| Direction | `path_len = 0xFF`               | `path_len ≠ 0xFF`                                                                                                                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Send      | Flood the network               | Direct route; the encoded path follows (low 6 bits = hash count, top 2 bits + 1 = hash size; on-wire byte count = `hash_count × hash_size`) |
| Receive   | Packet arrived via direct route | Packet was flooded; this is the encoded `pkt->path_len` field as observed (no path bytes follow)                                            |

In other words, the meaning of `0xFF` is inverted between the two directions, and on receive the field carries metadata only — never a routable path. `path_len` is an encoded byte (see `Packet::isValidPathLen` / `Packet::writePath` in `src/Packet.cpp`), not a raw byte count.

**Note**: The device may also emit `PACKET_MESSAGES_WAITING` (0x83) to notify the host that datagrams are queued; poll with `CMD_SYNC_NEXT_MESSAGE` (0x0A) to retrieve them.

**Parsing Pseudocode**:
```python
def parse_channel_data_recv(data):
    if len(data) < 9:
        return None
    snr_byte = data[1]
    snr = (snr_byte if snr_byte < 128 else snr_byte - 256) / 4.0
    channel_idx = data[4]
    path_len = data[5]
    data_type = int.from_bytes(data[6:8], 'little')
    data_len = data[8]
    if 9 + data_len > len(data):
        return None
    payload = data[9:9 + data_len]
    return {
        'snr': snr,
        'channel_idx': channel_idx,
        'path_len': path_len,
        'data_type': data_type,
        'payload': bytes(payload),
    }
```

---

### 7. Get Message

**Purpose**: Request the next queued message from the device.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0: 0x0A
```

**Example** (hex):
```
0A
```

**Response**: 
- `PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV` (0x08) or `PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV_V3` (0x11) for channel messages
- `PACKET_CONTACT_MSG_RECV` (0x07) or `PACKET_CONTACT_MSG_RECV_V3` (0x10) for contact messages
- `PACKET_CHANNEL_DATA_RECV` (0x1B) for channel data datagrams
- `PACKET_NO_MORE_MSGS` (0x0A) if no messages available

**Note**: Poll this command periodically to retrieve queued messages. The device may also send `PACKET_MESSAGES_WAITING` (0x83) as a notification when messages are available.

---

### 8. Get Battery and Storage

**Purpose**: Query device battery voltage and storage usage.

**Command Format**:
```
Byte 0: 0x14
```

**Example** (hex):
```
14
```

**Response**: `PACKET_BATTERY` (0x0C) with battery millivolts and storage information

---

## Channel Management

### Channel Types

1. **Public Channel**
    - Uses a publicly known 16-byte key: `8b3387e9c5cdea6ac9e5edbaa115cd72`
    - Anyone can join this channel, messages should be considered public
    - Used as the default public group chat
2. **Hashtag Channels**
    - Uses a secret key derived from the channel name
    - It is the first 16 bytes of `sha256("#test")`
    - For example hashtag channel `#test` has the key: `9cd8fcf22a47333b591d96a2b848b73f`
    - Traffic is encrypted on air, but anyone who knows or guesses the channel
      name can derive the key. Hashtag channels should not be treated as private.
    - Used as a topic based public group chat, separate from the default public channel
3. **Private Channels**
    - Uses a randomly generated 16-byte secret key
    - Messages should be considered private between those that know the secret
    - Users should keep the key secret, and only share with those you want to communicate with
    - Used as a secure private group chat

### Channel Lifecycle

1. **Set Channel**:
    - Fetch all channel slots, and find one with empty name and all-zero secret
    - Generate or provide a 16-byte secret
    - Send `CMD_SET_CHANNEL` with name and a 16-byte secret
2. **Get Channel**:
    - Send `CMD_GET_CHANNEL` with channel index
    - Parse `RESP_CODE_CHANNEL_INFO` response
3. **Delete Channel**:
    - Send `CMD_SET_CHANNEL` with empty name and all-zero secret
    - Or overwrite with a new channel

---

## Message Handling

### Receiving Messages

Messages are received via the TX characteristic (notifications). The device sends:

1. **Channel Messages**:
   - `PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV` (0x08) - Standard format
   - `PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV_V3` (0x11) - Version 3 with SNR

2. **Contact Messages**:
   - `PACKET_CONTACT_MSG_RECV` (0x07) - Standard format
   - `PACKET_CONTACT_MSG_RECV_V3` (0x10) - Version 3 with SNR

3. **Notifications**:
   - `PACKET_MESSAGES_WAITING` (0x83) - Indicates messages are queued

### Contact Message Format

**Parsing Pseudocode**:
```python
def parse_contact_message(data):
    packet_type = data[0]
    offset = 1
    
    # Check for V3 format
    if packet_type == 0x10:  # V3
        snr_byte = data[offset]
        snr = ((snr_byte if snr_byte < 128 else snr_byte - 256) / 4.0)
        offset += 3  # Skip SNR + reserved
    
    pubkey_prefix = data[offset:offset+6].hex()
    offset += 6
    
    path_len = data[offset]
    txt_type = data[offset + 1]
    offset += 2
    
    timestamp = int.from_bytes(data[offset:offset+4], 'little')
    offset += 4
    
    # If txt_type == 2, skip 4-byte signature
    if txt_type == 2:
        offset += 4
    
    message = data[offset:].decode('utf-8')
    
    return {
        'pubkey_prefix': pubkey_prefix,
        'path_len': path_len,
        'txt_type': txt_type,
        'timestamp': timestamp,
        'message': message,
        'snr': snr if packet_type == 0x10 else None
    }
```

### Channel Message Format

**Standard Format** (`PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV`, 0x08):
```
Byte 0: 0x08 (packet type)
Byte 1: Channel Index (0-7)
Byte 2: Path Length
Byte 3: Text Type
Bytes 4-7: Timestamp (32-bit little-endian)
Bytes 8+: Message Text (UTF-8)
```

**V3 Format** (`PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV_V3`, 0x11):
```
Byte 0: 0x11 (packet type)
Byte 1: SNR (signed byte, multiplied by 4)
Bytes 2-3: Reserved
Byte 4: Channel Index (0-7)
Byte 5: Path Length
Byte 6: Text Type
Bytes 7-10: Timestamp (32-bit little-endian)

```

**Parsing Pseudocode**:
```python
def parse_channel_message(data):
    packet_type = data[0]
    offset = 1
    
    # Check for V3 format
    if packet_type == 0x11:  # V3
        snr_byte = data[offset]
        snr = ((snr_byte if snr_byte < 128 else snr_byte - 256) / 4.0)
        offset += 3  # Skip SNR + reserved
    
    channel_idx = data[offset]
    path_len = data[offset + 1]
    txt_type = data[offset + 2]
    timestamp = int.from_bytes(data[offset+3:offset+7], 'little')
    message = data[offset+7:].decode('utf-8')
    
    return {
        'channel_idx': channel_idx,
        'timestamp': timestamp,
        'message': message,
        'snr': snr if packet_type == 0x11 else None
    }
```

### Sending Messages

Use the `SEND_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` command (see [Commands](#commands)).

**Important**: 
- Messages are limited to 133 characters per MeshCore specification
- Long messages should be split into chunks
- Include a chunk indicator (e.g., "[1/3] message text")

---

## Response Parsing

### Terminology

This document uses a spec-level naming convention (`PACKET_*`) for bytes the firmware sends back to the host. In the firmware source these same values are split across two `#define` families by purpose:

- `RESP_CODE_*` — direct replies to a command (e.g. `RESP_CODE_CHANNEL_DATA_RECV` = `PACKET_CHANNEL_DATA_RECV` = 0x1B).
- `PUSH_CODE_*` — asynchronous notifications not tied to a specific command (e.g. `PUSH_CODE_MSG_WAITING` = `PACKET_MESSAGES_WAITING` = 0x83).

Byte values are authoritative; names are aliases. When reading firmware source, `RESP_CODE_X` / `PUSH_CODE_X` correspond to this doc's `PACKET_X` of the same numeric value.

### Packet Types

| Value | Name                       | Description                   |
|-------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0x00  | PACKET_OK                  | Command succeeded             |
| 0x01  | PACKET_ERROR               | Command failed                |
| 0x02  | PACKET_CONTACT_START       | Start of contact list         |

### Error Codes

`PACKET_ERROR` (0x01) carries a single-byte error code in byte 1. Values match the `ERR_CODE_*` constants defined in `examples/companion_radio/MyMesh.cpp`:

| Code | Constant (firmware)        | Description                                                                  |
|------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | `ERR_CODE_UNSUPPORTED_CMD` | Unknown or unsupported command byte / sub-command                            |
| 2    | `ERR_CODE_NOT_FOUND`       | Target not found (channel, contact, message, etc.)                           |
| 3    | `ERR_CODE_TABLE_FULL`      | Internal queue or table is full — retry later                                |
| 4    | `ERR_CODE_BAD_STATE`       | Operation not valid in current device state (e.g. iterator already running)  |
| 5    | `ERR_CODE_FILE_IO_ERROR`   | Filesystem or storage I/O failure                                            |
| 6    | `ERR_CODE_ILLEGAL_ARG`     | Invalid argument (bad length, out-of-range value, reserved field, etc.)      |

**Note**: Error codes may vary by firmware version. Always check byte 1 of `PACKET_ERROR` response, and treat unknown codes as generic errors.

### Frame Handling

BLE implementations enqueue and deliver one protocol frame per BLE write/notification at the firmware layer.

- Apps should treat each characteristic write/notification as exactly one companion protocol frame
- Apps should still validate frame lengths before parsing
- Future transports or firmware revisions may differ, so avoid assuming fixed payload sizes for variable-length responses

### Response Handling

1. **Command-Response Pattern**:
   - Send command via RX characteristic
   - Wait for response via TX characteristic (notification)
   - Match response to command using sequence numbers or command type
   - Handle timeout (typically 5 seconds)
   - Use command queue to prevent concurrent commands

2. **Asynchronous Messages**:
   - Device may send messages at any time via TX characteristic
   - Handle `PACKET_MESSAGES_WAITING` (0x83) by polling `GET_MESSAGE` command
   - Parse incoming messages and route to appropriate handlers
   - Validate frame length before decoding

3. **Response Matching**:
   - Match responses to commands by expected packet type:
     - `APP_START` → `PACKET_SELF_INFO`
     - `DEVICE_QUERY` → `PACKET_DEVICE_INFO`
     - `GET_CHANNEL` → `PACKET_CHANNEL_INFO`
     - `SET_CHANNEL` → `PACKET_OK` or `PACKET_ERROR`
     - `SEND_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` → `PACKET_MSG_SENT`
     - `GET_MESSAGE` → `PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV`, `PACKET_CONTACT_MSG_RECV`, `PACKET_CHANNEL_DATA_RECV`, or `PACKET_NO_MORE_MSGS`
     - `SEND_CHANNEL_DATA` → `PACKET_OK` or `PACKET_ERROR`
     - `GET_BATTERY` → `PACKET_BATTERY`

4. **Timeout Handling**:
   - Default timeout: 5 seconds per command
   - On timeout: Log error, clear current command, proceed to next in queue
   - Some commands may take longer (e.g., `SET_CHANNEL` may need 1-2 seconds)
   - Consider longer timeout for channel operations

5. **Error Recovery**:
   - On `PACKET_ERROR`: Log error code, clear current command
   - On connection loss: Clear command queue, attempt reconnection
   - On invalid response: Log warning, clear current command, proceed

## Example Implementation Flow

### Initialization

```python
# 1. Scan for MeshCore device
device = scan_for_device("MeshCore")

# 2. Connect to BLE GATT
gatt = connect_to_device(device)

# 3. Discover services and characteristics
service = discover_service(gatt, "6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E")
rx_char = discover_characteristic(service, "6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E")
tx_char = discover_characteristic(service, "6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E")

# 4. Enable notifications on TX characteristic
enable_notifications(tx_char, on_notification_received)

# 5. Send AppStart command
send_command(rx_char, build_app_start())
wait_for_response(PACKET_SELF_INFO)
```

### Creating a Private Channel

```python
# 1. Generate 16-byte secret
secret_16_bytes = generate_secret(16)  # Use CSPRNG
secret_hex = secret_16_bytes.hex()

# 2. Build SET_CHANNEL command
channel_name = "YourChannelName"
channel_index = 1  # Use 1-7 for private channels
command = build_set_channel(channel_index, channel_name, secret_16_bytes)

# 3. Send command
send_command(rx_char, command)
response = wait_for_response(PACKET_OK)

# 4. Store secret locally
store_channel_secret(channel_index, secret_hex)
```

### Sending a Message

```python
# 1. Build channel message command
channel_index = 1
message = "Hello, MeshCore!"
timestamp = int(time.time())
command = build_channel_message(channel_index, message, timestamp)

# 2. Send command
send_command(rx_char, command)
response = wait_for_response(PACKET_MSG_SENT)
```

### Receiving Messages

```python
def on_notification_received(data):
    packet_type = data[0]
    
    if packet_type == PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV or packet_type == PACKET_CHANNEL_MSG_RECV_V3:
        message = parse_channel_message(data)
        handle_channel_message(message)
    elif packet_type == PACKET_MESSAGES_WAITING:
        # Poll for messages
        send_command(rx_char, build_get_message())
```

## Best Practices

1. **Connection Management**:
   - Implement auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
   - Handle disconnections gracefully
   - Store last connected device address for quick reconnection

2. **Secret Management**:
   - Always use cryptographically secure random number generators
   - Store secrets securely (encrypted storage)
   - Never log or transmit secrets in plain text

3. **Message Handling**:
   - Send `CMD_SYNC_NEXT_MESSAGE` when `PUSH_CODE_MSG_WAITING` is received
   - Implement message deduplication to avoid displaying the same message twice

4. **Channel Management**:
    - Fetch all channel slots even if you encounter an empty slot
    - Ideally save new channels into the first empty slot

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement timeouts for all commands (typically 5 seconds)
   - Handle `RESP_CODE_ERR` responses appropriately

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- **Device not found**: Ensure device is powered on and advertising
- **Connection timeout**: Check Bluetooth permissions and device proximity
- **GATT errors**: Ensure proper service/characteristic discovery

### Command Issues

- **No response**: Verify notifications are enabled, check connection state
- **Error responses**: Verify command format and check error code
- **Timeout**: Increase timeout value or try again

### Message Issues

- **Messages not received**: Poll `GET_MESSAGE` command periodically
- **Duplicate messages**: Implement message deduplication using timestamp/content as a unique id
- **Message truncation**: Send long messages as separate shorter messages
